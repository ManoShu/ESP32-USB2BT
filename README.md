A version of [juancgarcia's HID-Relay](https://github.com/juancgarcia/HID-Relay) using a ESP32 instead of a modified HC-06 Bluetooth transciever.

Advantage would be no need for hacking components, trading off a larger footprint.

The "receiver" is for your usual Pro Mini + Mini UHS combo

The "transmitter" for a ESP32 (in my case board ID "mhetesp32devkit")

#### UNSTABLE! 
As it is, it's losing connection and not recovering. Also, not connection when turned on.

It's more of a proof of concept at this point.
